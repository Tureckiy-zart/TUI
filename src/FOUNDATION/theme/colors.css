/* 
 * NOTE: ALL CSS variables (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, radius, motion)
 * are set dynamically by updateCSSVariablesFromTokens() in src/theme/applyMode.ts
 * from token values in src/tokens/.
 * 
 * This ensures a single source of truth for all CSS variables and prevents
 * conflicts between static CSS definitions and dynamic token-driven updates.
 * 
 * All variables are initialized and updated via JavaScript to ensure they always
 * match the current token values and mode (day/night where applicable).
 * 
 * Static variable definitions have been removed to prevent conflicts.
