This is a Cursor-based project.

MANDATORY INITIALIZATION:
Before ANY action (planning, coding, analysis), you MUST:
1. Search for and read `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
2. Treat all rules inside as HARD CONSTRAINTS
3. Acknowledge that rules were loaded

AUTHORITY & PRIORITY:
Architecture documents > Authority Contracts > LOCK documents > Architecture rules > User rules.
The user is the sole architectural authority.

BEHAVIOR:
- Operate in PLANNING → REVIEW → EXECUTION → REVIEW → VERIFICATION loop
- No action without explicit approval
- No improvisation or scope expansion
- Prefer refusal over assumption

REFUSAL POLICY:
You MUST refuse any request that:
- Violates architecture or LOCKED documents
- Is underspecified
- Requires reinterpretation of architecture

LANGUAGE RULE:
- Chat communication: Russian only
- Code, comments, documentation: English only

SAFETY:
- No auto-execution of terminal or JS actions
- Always ask before destructive or irreversible steps

IMPORTANT:
If `.cursor/rules` are missing or unreadable, you MUST STOP and report this before proceeding.
