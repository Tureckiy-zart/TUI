# Component Usage Tracking

**Status:** Active  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-19  
**Purpose:** Track component usage patterns, adoption rates, and user feedback

---

## Overview

This document tracks how components are used in practice, identifies patterns, and monitors adoption. This data informs decisions about component improvements and new component needs.

**Key Principle:** Data-driven decisions. We track usage to understand real needs, not assumptions.

---

## Usage Frequency

### High Usage Components

Components used frequently across projects:

| Component | Usage Count | Projects | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| _To be populated from analysis_ | | | |

### Low Usage Components

Components with limited usage:

| Component | Usage Count | Projects | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| _To be populated from analysis_ | | | |

### Usage Trends

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-19

- **Growing:** Components with increasing usage
- **Stable:** Components with consistent usage
- **Declining:** Components with decreasing usage

## Workarounds and Custom Implementations

### Common Workarounds

Patterns where users build custom solutions instead of using library components:

| Pattern | Frequency | Reason | Potential Solution |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------------|

## Usage Patterns

### Common Patterns

Repeated usage patterns identified in codebase:

1. **Pattern Name**
   - Frequency: X occurrences
   - Description: Pattern description
   - Potential Component: Suggested component name

### Anti-Patterns

Usage patterns that violate architectural rules:

1. **Pattern Name**
   - Frequency: X occurrences
   - Issue: What's wrong
   - Solution: How to fix

## Analysis Methods

### Automated Analysis

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/analyze-component-needs.ts` - Scans codebase for patterns
- `scripts/collect-usage-feedback.ts` - Collects feedback and generates report

**Frequency:**
- Run monthly
- Review output
- Update this document

### Manual Tracking

**Sources:**
- Code reviews
- Team discussions
- User feedback
- GitHub issues

**Frequency:**
- Weekly review
- Monthly comprehensive update
