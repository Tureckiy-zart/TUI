# 📚 TUI Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-16  
**Purpose:** Central documentation hub for the TUI component library

## 🏛️ Foundation Status

**Foundation Authorities are CLOSED and IMMUTABLE.** See [FOUNDATION_LOCK.md](./architecture/FOUNDATION_LOCK.md) for the authoritative Foundation lock status and details. Enforcement and Extension layers are **OPEN** for development.

## 📖 Canonical Context

This project uses a single canonical internal context.

You MUST treat `docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md` as the only source of truth for:
– architecture
– design decisions
– Foundation vs Extension rules
– token system
– styling constraints
– public API rules
– future evolution

Do NOT infer architecture from any other files.
Do NOT ask clarifying questions already answered there.
Assume all architectural decisions are final unless explicitly changed in that document.

**Important:** Foundation Authorities are **CLOSED** and **IMMUTABLE**. Do not request modifications to Authority Contracts. Only Enforcement mechanisms and Extension components can be developed.

Master tasks and progress tracking exist separately and do not redefine architecture.
