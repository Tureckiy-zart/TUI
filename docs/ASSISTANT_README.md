# 📚 TUI Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-17  
**Purpose:** Central documentation hub for the TUI component library

## 🏛️ Foundation Status

**Foundation Authorities are CLOSED and IMMUTABLE.** See [FOUNDATION_LOCK.md](./architecture/FOUNDATION_LOCK.md) for the authoritative Foundation lock status and details. Enforcement and Extension layers are **OPEN** for development.

---

## Canonical Context

`docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md` is the primary source of truth for:
- architecture
- design decisions
- Foundation vs Extension rules
- token system
- styling constraints
- public API rules
- future evolution

Canonical documents are listed in `docs/CANONICAL_DOCUMENTATION_INVENTORY.md`.
Authoritative decisions live in LAW documents per `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md`.
Use other canonical documents as needed and resolve conflicts using the
document resolution order defined by project rules.

**Important:** Foundation Authorities are **CLOSED** and **IMMUTABLE**. Do not request modifications to Authority Contracts. Only Enforcement mechanisms and Extension components can be developed.

Master tasks and progress tracking exist separately and do not redefine architecture.
