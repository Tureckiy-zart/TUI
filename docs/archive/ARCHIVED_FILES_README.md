# Archived Documentation Files

**Date:** 2025-12-13  
**Reason:** These files have been superseded by `docs/INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md`

## Archived Files

All architectural documentation that was replaced by the canonical context has been moved to this archive:

### Architecture Files (docs/archive/architecture/)

- **CURSOR_UI_RULES.md** - Cursor AI development rules (content synthesized into INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md Section 12)
- **FINAL_FOUNDATION_LOCK.md** - Foundation lock details (content synthesized into INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md Section 4)
- **TUI_ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md** - Architecture lock details (content synthesized into INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md Sections 3, 4, 5)
- **UI_ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md** - Radix UI and token union rules (content synthesized into INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md Sections 2, 6, 7)

### Core Context Files (docs/archive/core/)

- **TENERIFEUI_CORECONTEXT_v1.0.md** - Old Russian version of context (replaced by INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md)
- **TENERIFEUI_CORECONTEXT_GPT.md** - Empty placeholder file (replaced by INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md)

## Why These Files Were Archived

The `docs/INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md` document is the **single source of truth** for TenerifeUI architecture. All architectural decisions, rules, and principles have been synthesized and consolidated into this canonical document.

These archived files:
- Contained information now fully covered in the canonical context
- Created potential for conflicting information
- Were referenced as "supplementary" but their content is now canonical

## Current Architecture Documentation

**Primary Source:**
- `docs/INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md` - The canonical architectural context (IMMUTABLE, CRITICAL)

**Complementary Sources:**
- `.cursor/tasks/master/master_tasks.json` - Master Task system
- `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` - Project progress tracking

**Technical Rules (Still Active):**
- `docs/architecture/LINTING_RULES.md` - Linting rules
- `docs/architecture/TOOLING_DECISIONS.md` - Tooling decisions

## Access

These files are preserved for historical reference but should **NOT** be used for architectural decisions. Always refer to `docs/INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md` instead.
