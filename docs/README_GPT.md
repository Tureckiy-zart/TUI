# 📚 TUI Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-12  
**Purpose:** Central documentation hub for the TUI component library

---
This project uses a single canonical internal context.

You MUST treat `docs/INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md` as the only source of truth for:
– architecture
– design decisions
– Foundation vs Extension rules
– token system
– styling constraints
– public API rules
– future evolution

Do NOT infer architecture from any other files.
Do NOT ask clarifying questions already answered there.
Assume all architectural decisions are final unless explicitly changed in that document.

Master tasks and progress tracking exist separately and do not redefine architecture.
