## 🏛️ Foundation Status

**Foundation Authorities are CLOSED and IMMUTABLE.**

The Foundation architecture phase is **OFFICIALLY CLOSED**. All Foundation Authorities (Interaction, State, Layout, Token, Spacing, Radius, Typography, Motion, Elevation) are **LOCKED** and **IMMUTABLE**.

**Source of Truth:** For the authoritative, definitive Foundation lock status, see **[FINAL_FOUNDATION_LOCK.md](./architecture/FINAL_FOUNDATION_LOCK.md)**. This document is the single source of truth for the locked Foundation layer.

**Current Phase:** Enforcement and Extension layers are **OPEN** for development. All future work must occur in these layers only.

## 📖 Canonical Context

This project uses a single canonical internal context.

You MUST treat `docs/INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md` as the only source of truth for:
– architecture
– design decisions
– Foundation vs Extension rules
– token system
– styling constraints
– public API rules
– future evolution

Do NOT infer architecture from any other files.
Do NOT ask clarifying questions already answered there.
Assume all architectural decisions are final unless explicitly changed in that document.

**Important:** Foundation Authorities are **CLOSED** and **IMMUTABLE**. Do not request modifications to Authority Contracts. Only Enforcement mechanisms and Extension components can be developed.

Master tasks and progress tracking exist separately and do not redefine architecture.
