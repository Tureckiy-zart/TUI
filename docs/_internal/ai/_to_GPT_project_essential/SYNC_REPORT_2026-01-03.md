## Sync Operation (T4)

**Result:** ✅ All changed files successfully synced and verified

- **Files synced:** 8
- **Files verified:** 8/8 (100%)
- **Sync method:** Direct copy with verification
- **File numbering:** Preserved (01-18 prefixes maintained)

---

## File Relevance Evaluation (T3)

**Result:** ✅ Current file selection remains optimal

### Coverage Analysis

The current selection of 18 files provides comprehensive coverage of all critical areas:

#### ✅ Must Include (All Present)

- ✅ Core architecture (`ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md`)
- ✅ Foundation lock status (`FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`)
- ✅ Architecture lock (`ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md`)
- ✅ Project orientation (`PROJECT_ORIENTATION.md`)
- ✅ Project progress (`PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`)
- ✅ Authority navigation (`AUTHORITY_NAVIGATION.md`)
- ✅ Extension boundaries (`EXTENSION_AUTHORITY.md`)
- ✅ Token system (`TOKEN_AUTHORITY.md`)
- ✅ State system (`STATE_MATRIX.md`, `STATE_AUTHORITY.md`, `INTERACTION_AUTHORITY.md`)
- ✅ Foundation contract (`FOUNDATION_CONTRACT.md`)
- ✅ Extension state (`EXTENSION_STATE.md`)
- ✅ Typing standards (`TYPING_STANDARD.md`)

#### ✅ Should Include (All Present)

- ✅ Token Authority examples (`SPACING_AUTHORITY.md`)
- ✅ Layout Authority (`LAYOUT_AUTHORITY.md`)
- ✅ Architecture rules (`ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`)
- ✅ Foundation lifecycle process (`COMPONENT_REFACTORING_PIPELINE.md`)

### Coverage Areas Assessment

| Coverage Area | Status | Files |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Architecture (Foundation + Extension) | ✅ Covered | ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md, EXTENSION_AUTHORITY.md |
| Authority Contracts (core contracts) | ✅ Covered | TOKEN_AUTHORITY.md, STATE_MATRIX.md, STATE_AUTHORITY.md, INTERACTION_AUTHORITY.md, SPACING_AUTHORITY.md, LAYOUT_AUTHORITY.md |
| Foundation Status (lock, contract, enforcement) | ✅ Covered | FOUNDATION_LOCK.md, FOUNDATION_CONTRACT.md |
| Foundation Lifecycle (step pipeline process) | ✅ Covered | COMPONENT_REFACTORING_PIPELINE.md |
| Extension Rules (boundaries, state) | ✅ Covered | EXTENSION_AUTHORITY.md, EXTENSION_STATE.md |
| State System (WHAT/WHEN/HOW layers) | ✅ Covered | STATE_MATRIX.md, STATE_AUTHORITY.md, INTERACTION_AUTHORITY.md |
| Current State (progress, orientation) | ✅ Covered | PROJECT_PROGRESS.md, PROJECT_ORIENTATION.md |
| Standards (typing) | ✅ Covered | TYPING_STANDARD.md |

### Additional Authority Contracts Not Included

The following Authority Contracts exist but are not included in the current selection:

- `RADIUS_AUTHORITY.md` - Radius token usage (ACTIVE)
- `TYPOGRAPHY_AUTHORITY.md` - Typography token usage (ACTIVE)
- `MOTION_AUTHORITY.md` - Motion token usage (ACTIVE)
- `ELEVATION_AUTHORITY.md` - Elevation token usage (ACTIVE)
- `FOCUS_AUTHORITY.md` - Focus navigation (LOCKED)
- `A11Y_AUTHORITY.md` - Accessibility rules (LOCKED)
- `INPUT_AUTHORITY.md` - Input component rules
- `INTERACTIVE_SIZE_SCALE_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md` - Interactive size scale (LOCKED)

**Assessment:** These additional Authority Contracts provide domain-specific rules but are not critical for basic architectural understanding. The current selection covers the core architecture, state system, token system foundation, and Foundation/Extension boundaries, which are sufficient for GPT project context understanding.

**Recommendation:** Current file selection remains optimal. No changes recommended unless specific domain expertise (accessibility, typography, motion, etc.) is required.

---

## Final Status

### Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ All 18 files present in `_to_GPT_project_essential/`
- ✅ All source files synced (8 files updated)
- ✅ File selection evaluated for relevance
- ✅ Sync report generated

### Success Metrics

- ✅ All essential files are up-to-date
- ✅ File selection remains optimal for GPT project understanding
- ✅ Sync process is repeatable and reliable

---

## Next Steps

1. **Periodic Sync:** Run this sync task periodically to keep essential docs up-to-date
2. **File Selection Review:** Review file selection if documentation structure changes significantly
3. **Coverage Monitoring:** Monitor if additional Authority Contracts become critical for GPT project understanding

---

## Notes

- Only architectural documents are included (no Cursor/AI operational rules)
- Files are numbered with prefixes (01-18) for logical reading order
- All files verified byte-by-byte after sync
- File modification dates preserved during sync
