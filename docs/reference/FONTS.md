# Fonts (Optional)

TUI ships with **system font fallbacks** by default. We do **not** bundle or require fonts.

If you want canonical visuals, you can load Inter / Clash Display / Satoshi in your app,
but this is optional. When fonts are not provided, the system falls back to system sans.

Recommended (optional) families:
- Base text: Inter
- Display headings: Clash Display
- Alternate: Satoshi
