# Canonical State Final - Architecture Truth Snapshot

**Status:** ⚠️ **ARCHIVED / SUPERSEDED**  
**Date:** 2025-12-17  
**Superseded By:** [ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md](./ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md)

---

## ⚠️ This Document Has Been Superseded

This document has been **merged into** the primary canonical architecture document:

**👉 [ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md](./ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md)** - **PRIMARY CANONICAL SOURCE**

All architectural rules, canonical implementations, and location rules have been consolidated into the Architecture Lock document.

---

## What Was Merged

The following architectural assertions from this document were merged into `ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md`:

- ✅ **Overlay Location Rule** - Overlays live only in COMPOSITION layer
- ✅ **Canonical Implementation Paths** - Specific file paths for all canonical components
- ✅ **Card Location Rule** - Card primitives in COMPOSITION, patterns in PATTERNS
- ✅ **Toast Hooks Naming Rule** - camelCase naming convention
- ✅ **FOUNDATION Tokens Rule** - Tokens only exist for active components

## Historical Content

The historical migration records and verification results from this document have been preserved for reference but are no longer part of the canonical architecture documentation. For current architectural rules, see:
