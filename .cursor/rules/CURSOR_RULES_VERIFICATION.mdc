# Cursor Rules Verification & Activation (Canonical)

## Purpose

This document formally verifies that all Cursor / AI rules
are **complete, non-conflicting, and safe to apply**.

It represents the **official verification checkpoint**
after which further project work is allowed to proceed.

Without this document, the rule system is considered **unverified**.

---

## Verified Rule Set

The following Cursor rule documents are verified and active:

- `rules/user-rules.mdc`
- `rules/component-lifecycle.mdc`
- `rules/block-and-scope-rules.mdc`
- `rules/CURSOR_RULES_RESOLUTION_ORDER.mdc`
- `rules/COMPONENT_CREATION_AND_REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.mdc`


These documents together define:
- AI behavior
- Component lifecycle enforcement
- Scope and boundary enforcement
- Deterministic rule resolution

No additional Cursor rules are considered active.

---

## Coverage Verification

The following risk areas are explicitly covered:

### ✅ Architectural Integrity
- Foundation layers are immutable
- Authority Contracts are enforced
- Lock documents override lower rules

### ✅ Component Creation & Refactoring
- Mandatory lifecycle protocol defined
- Task classification enforced
- Explicit refusal conditions defined

### ✅ Scope & Boundary Control
- One task = one component or block
- Cross-scope refactors forbidden
- Hidden changes prohibited

### ✅ Token System Safety
- Raw values forbidden
- Token unions enforced
- New tokens require separate tasks

### ✅ AI Behavior & Refusal
- Explicit refusal policy defined
- Silent compliance forbidden
- Clarification required on ambiguity

### ✅ Documentation Safety
- Correct real-world date enforced
- Future dates explicitly forbidden
- Guessing dates forbidden

### ✅ Archive & Context Isolation
- Archived documentation excluded
- No reliance on removed or legacy rules
- No inference from non-canonical sources

### ✅ Legacy Component Refactor Safety
- Mandatory refactor checklist defined
- Safe migration from legacy components enforced

## Conflict Verification

The verified rule set was reviewed for conflicts.

Result:
- ❌ No conflicting rules detected
- ❌ No circular authority references
- ❌ No ambiguous priority resolution

Rule resolution order is fully deterministic.

---

## Resolution Order Verification

The AI MUST resolve rules using the following verified order:

1. `docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md`
2. `docs/architecture/AUTHORITY_NAVIGATION.md`
3. Authority Contracts (see `docs/architecture/AUTHORITY_NAVIGATION.md` for complete list)
4. Lock documents: `docs/architecture/FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`, `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md`
5. Architecture rules: `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`, `docs/architecture/EXTENSION_STATE.md`
6. Cursor rules
7. Task instructions

This order is explicitly enforced and verified.

---

## Activation Statement

All Cursor rules listed in this document are:

- Verified
- Active
- Mandatory

The AI is authorized to operate **only within these rules**.

Any task that cannot be completed without violating them
MUST be refused.

---

## Change Control

Any modification to the verified rule set requires:

- Explicit instruction
- Review against Authority and Locks
- Re-verification via an updated version of this document

Unverified changes are forbidden.

---

## Final Verdict

**Cursor Rules Status: VERIFIED & SAFE TO PROCEED**

Further development, refactoring, and analysis
may continue under these rules.

This document closes the Cursor Rules verification phase.
