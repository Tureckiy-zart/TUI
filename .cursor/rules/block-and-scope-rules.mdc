# Block & Scope Enforcement Rules (Canonical)

## Purpose

This document defines **strict scope and boundary enforcement rules**
for Cursor / AI when working with blocks, components, and code structures.

These rules exist to prevent:
- uncontrolled refactors
- scope leakage
- architectural drift
- accidental cross-component changes

Compliance is mandatory.

---

## Scope Principle (MANDATORY)

The AI MUST operate **only within the explicitly defined scope** of the current task.

Explicit scope includes:
- files listed in the task
- components explicitly named in the task
- blocks explicitly referenced in the task description

Anything not explicitly included is considered **out of scope**.

---

## One Task = One Target

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the AI MUST assume:

- One task targets **one block OR one component**
- Cross-block or cross-component changes are forbidden
- Shared utilities, tokens, or helpers are out of scope by default

If a task implicitly requires touching multiple components,
the AI MUST STOP and ASK for permission.

---

## Forbidden Scope Expansion

The AI MUST NOT:

- Refactor adjacent components “for consistency”
- Clean up unrelated code “while here”
- Rename files, folders, or exports not required by the task
- Apply formatting changes outside the modified lines
- Update dependencies, configs, or tooling unless explicitly requested

Scope expansion for convenience is forbidden.

---

## Block Boundary Rules

Blocks represent **architectural boundaries**.

The AI MUST:

- Treat each block as an isolated unit
- Avoid leaking logic across block boundaries
- Avoid coupling blocks through shared state or side effects

The AI MUST NOT:

- Move logic between blocks without explicit instruction
- Merge blocks implicitly
- Create hidden dependencies between blocks

---

## Component Boundary Rules

Components are **self-contained units**.

The AI MUST:

- Modify only the component specified in the task
- Respect the public API of the component
- Avoid changing component behavior outside the requested change

The AI MUST NOT:

- Alter component contracts unintentionally
- Change props, tokens, or behavior not required by the task
- Introduce breaking changes silently

---

## Extension Boundary Enforcement

Foundation and locked layers are immutable.

The AI MUST:

- Verify that changes occur only in allowed extension areas
- Respect all Lock documents and Authority Contracts:
  - Lock documents: `docs/architecture/FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`, `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md`
  - Authority Contracts: see `docs/architecture/AUTHORITY_NAVIGATION.md` for complete list

The AI MUST NOT:

- Modify Foundation components
- Bypass extension boundaries
- Reinterpret locked decisions

If a task requires violating this rule,
the AI MUST REFUSE.

---

## Refactor Constraints

When refactoring is explicitly allowed, the AI MUST:

- Refactor only what is explicitly requested
- Keep behavior identical unless change is specified
- Avoid stylistic or structural changes beyond scope

The AI MUST NOT:

- Perform opportunistic refactors
- Reorganize files or folders
- Change naming conventions unless explicitly requested

---

## Hidden Changes Prohibition

The AI MUST NOT introduce:

- Side effects outside the target component or block
- Changes to shared utilities without permission
- Indirect behavior changes through refactors

All changes must be **direct, intentional, and visible**.

---

## Enforcement & Refusal

The AI MUST REFUSE when:

- The task requires scope expansion
- The task requires cross-component or cross-block changes
- The task requires modifying locked or Foundation code
- The task cannot be completed without violating these rules

A refusal MUST include:
- A clear reason
- Reference to the violated rule
- A suggested next step if applicable

Silent compliance is forbidden.

---

## Final Enforcement Principle

Scope discipline is mandatory.

If the AI is unsure whether an action is in scope,
it MUST assume it is **out of scope** and STOP.

When in doubt — REFUSE or ASK.
