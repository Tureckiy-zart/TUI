# User Rules (Canonical)

## Status

This document defines **mandatory behavioral rules** for Cursor / AI.
These rules apply to ALL tasks without exception.

This document defines **how the AI must think and behave**, not how to implement code.

---

## Rule Resolution Order

When performing any task, the AI MUST resolve rules in the following order:

1. `docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md`
2. Authority Contracts (see `docs/architecture/AUTHORITY_NAVIGATION.md` for complete list):
   - `docs/architecture/ELEVATION_AUTHORITY.md`
   - `docs/architecture/EXTENSION_AUTHORITY.md`
   - `docs/architecture/INTERACTION_AUTHORITY.md`
   - `docs/architecture/LAYOUT_AUTHORITY.md`
   - `docs/architecture/MOTION_AUTHORITY.md`
   - `docs/architecture/RADIUS_AUTHORITY.md`
   - `docs/architecture/SPACING_AUTHORITY.md`
   - `docs/architecture/STATE_AUTHORITY.md`
   - `docs/architecture/TYPOGRAPHY_AUTHORITY.md`
3. Lock documents:
   - `docs/architecture/FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`
   - `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md`
4. Architecture rules:
   - `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`
   - `docs/architecture/EXTENSION_STATE.md`
5. User Rules (this document)

If a conflict exists, the AI MUST follow the higher-priority rule.
Lower-priority rules must be ignored.

---

## Core AI Behavior

The AI MUST:
- Follow Authority and Lock documents strictly
- Refuse tasks that violate architectural constraints
- Ask for clarification when requirements are incomplete
- Work only within the explicitly defined task scope

The AI MUST NOT:
- Invent missing requirements, APIs, tokens, or components
- Apply patterns from other projects
- Perform architectural “improvements” without explicit instruction
- Modify code or documents outside the current task scope

The AI MUST follow all active execution checklists
when creating or refactoring components,
including:
- rules/COMPONENT_CREATION_AND_REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.mdc


---

## Refusal Policy (MANDATORY)

The AI MUST explicitly REFUSE when:
- A task attempts to modify locked components or layers
- A task violates Authority Contracts
- A task spans multiple components without permission
- A task introduces new tokens, domains, or scales without a dedicated task
- A task requires refactoring code not created or explicitly included in the task

A refusal MUST include:
- A short reason
- A reference to the violated rule
- A suggested next step if possible

Silent compliance is forbidden.

---

## Documentation Date Rule (CRITICAL)

When creating or updating documentation:
- The AI MUST use the **current real-world date**
- The AI MUST NEVER generate future dates
- The AI MUST verify the date before writing

If the correct current date cannot be determined with certainty,
the AI MUST ASK instead of guessing.

This rule overrides all templates and examples.

---

## Date and Time Rules

### Date Format

**ALWAYS** use ISO 8601 date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

- **Format**: Use current actual date (e.g., `2025-12-19`)
- **Timezone**: Use system date/time (current actual date)
- **Examples**: 
  - ✅ `2025-12-19` (correct - current date)
  - ❌ `2025-01-20` (wrong - old date)
  - ❌ `2024-12-19` (wrong - old date)

### Date Usage Rules

**ALWAYS** follow these rules when working with dates:

1. **When updating progress files:**
   - Use **current actual date** from system
   - **NEVER** use hardcoded dates from examples or old code
   - **NEVER** copy dates from other files without checking

2. **When creating reports:**
   - Use **current actual date** for "Date Created" or "Last Updated"
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

3. **When updating documentation:**
   - Update "Last Updated" field with **current actual date**
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

4. **When updating task status:**
   - Use **current actual date** for completion dates
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

### How to Get Current Date

**ALWAYS** get current date using one of these methods:

1. **Terminal command**: `date +"%Y-%m-%d"` (returns current date in YYYY-MM-DD format)
2. **System date**: Use actual current date, not dates from examples
3. **Verify**: If unsure, run `date +"%Y-%m-%d"` to get current date

### Date Examples

**Correct usage:**
```markdown
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-19
**Date Completed:** 2025-12-19
```

**Incorrect usage:**
```markdown
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-20 (wrong - old date)
**Date Completed:** 2024-12-19 (wrong - old date)
```

### Critical Rule

**NEVER** use dates from:
- ❌ Examples in documentation
- ❌ Old code comments
- ❌ Previous file versions
- ❌ Hardcoded dates in templates

**ALWAYS** use:
- ✅ Current system date
- ✅ Date from `date +"%Y-%m-%d"` command
- ✅ Actual current date when updating files

## Safety Principle

Correctness and constraint have priority over speed or convenience.

If any uncertainty exists, the AI MUST STOP and ASK.
