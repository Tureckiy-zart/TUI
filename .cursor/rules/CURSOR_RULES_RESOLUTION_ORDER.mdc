# Cursor Rules Resolution Order (Canonical)

## Purpose

This document defines the **single, mandatory rule resolution order**
that Cursor / AI MUST follow when multiple documents, rules,
or constraints are applicable.

This order is **not advisory**.
It is **enforcement logic**.

Any deviation is forbidden.

---

## Core Principle

When multiple rules apply to a task, **only one decision path is valid**.

The AI MUST resolve rules **strictly in the order defined below**.
Lower-priority rules MUST NEVER override higher-priority rules.

If a lower-priority rule conflicts with a higher-priority rule,
the lower-priority rule MUST be ignored.

---

## Mandatory Resolution Order

The AI MUST resolve rules in the following exact order:

### 1️⃣ `docs/INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md`

- Defines the global architecture
- Defines Foundation vs Extension boundaries
- Defines non-negotiable system principles

This is the **single source of truth**.

If a task conflicts with this document, the AI MUST REFUSE.

---

### 2️⃣ `docs/architecture/AUTHORITY_MAP.md`

- Defines which Authority Contract governs which domain
- Defines ownership of rules
- Provides navigation for rule lookup

The AI MUST use this map to identify the correct Authority Contract.

The AI MUST NOT bypass this step.

---

### 3️⃣ Authority Contracts

- Define immutable domain laws (tokens, spacing, typography, motion, etc.)
- Foundation Authority Contracts are **LOCKED**
- Extension Authority Contracts define allowed extension boundaries
- Complete list available in `docs/architecture/AUTHORITY_MAP.md`:
  - `docs/architecture/ELEVATION_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/architecture/EXTENSION_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/architecture/INTERACTION_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/architecture/LAYOUT_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/architecture/MOTION_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/architecture/RADIUS_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/architecture/SPACING_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/architecture/STATE_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/architecture/TYPOGRAPHY_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT.md`

If a task violates an Authority Contract, the AI MUST REFUSE.

Authority Contracts override:
- Architecture guides
- Cursor rules
- User instructions

---

### 4️⃣ Lock Documents

- Define explicitly locked components, layers, or decisions
- Override all non-Authority documents
- Lock documents:
  - `docs/architecture/FINAL_FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`
  - `docs/architecture/TUI_ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md`

If a target component or layer is LOCKED,
the AI MUST REFUSE immediately.

No workaround is allowed.

---

### 5️⃣ Architecture Rules

Includes:
- `docs/architecture/UI_ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`
- `docs/architecture/TUI_ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md` (also listed as Lock document)
- `docs/architecture/TUI_EXTENSION_CANONICAL_STATE.md`

These rules define **how** the system may be modified,
but never override Authority or Lock documents.

If Architecture Rules conflict with Authority or Locks,
the AI MUST follow Authority / Locks.

---

### 6️⃣ Cursor Rules

Includes:
- rules/user-rules.mdc
- rules/component-lifecycle.mdc
- rules/block-and-scope-rules.mdc
- rules/COMPONENT_CREATION_AND_REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.mdc
- rules/CURSOR_RULES_RESOLUTION_ORDER.mdc


These rules define **AI behavior and enforcement**.

Cursor Rules MUST NEVER override:
- `docs/INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md`
- Authority Contracts (see `docs/architecture/AUTHORITY_MAP.md`)
- Lock documents (`docs/architecture/FINAL_FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`, `docs/architecture/TUI_ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md`)

---

### 7️⃣ Task Instructions

Task-specific instructions apply **only within the constraints**
defined by all higher-priority rules.

If task instructions conflict with any higher-level rule,
the AI MUST REFUSE.

---

## Conflict Handling

When a conflict is detected, the AI MUST:

1. Identify the highest-priority rule involved
2. Ignore all conflicting lower-priority rules
3. REFUSE the task if compliance is impossible
4. Explain the refusal with reference to the violated rule

The AI MUST NOT:
- Attempt compromise solutions
- Partially comply
- Invent exceptions

---

## Forbidden Behaviors

The AI MUST NOT:

- Choose rules arbitrarily
- Average or merge conflicting rules
- Follow the most recent or longest rule
- Follow user preference over Authority or Locks

Rule resolution is **deterministic**, not interpretive.

---

## Enforcement Guarantee

This resolution order applies to:
- All coding tasks
- All documentation tasks
- All refactors
- All analysis and recommendations

There are no exceptions.

---

## Final Statement

If a rule is not respected because it was lower priority,
that rule is considered **inactive for the task**.

The AI MUST never state:
> “Rules are unclear”  
without first applying this resolution order.

This document is **final and authoritative**.
