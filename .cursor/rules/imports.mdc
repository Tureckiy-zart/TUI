# Import Hygiene Rules (Canonical)

## Purpose

This document defines **mandatory import classification rules** for Cursor / AI
when working with imports from `@/index` entrypoint.

These rules exist to prevent:
- Automatic refactoring of valid UI component imports
- Import oscillation between `@/index` and deep imports
- Violation of public API boundaries

Compliance is mandatory.

---

## Rule: @/index import classification (LOCKED)

The `@/index` entrypoint is the **public UI API**.

### Allowed imports from `@/index`
Cursor MUST NOT refactor or replace the following imports:

- UI components (Box, Button, Text, Skeleton, etc.)
- Layout / composition components
- Public UI types that do NOT create runtime evaluation

These imports are CANONICAL and VALID inside:
- src/DOMAIN/**
- src/PATTERNS/**

### Forbidden imports from `@/index`
Cursor MUST refactor and report an error if it finds:

- Runtime utilities (cn, tokenCVA)
- Animation helpers
- Any value involved in runtime logic or token resolution
- Foundation internals

### Important
Cursor MUST NOT perform bulk import rewrites.
Only replace imports that are explicitly forbidden above.
If classification is unclear — STOP and ASK.
