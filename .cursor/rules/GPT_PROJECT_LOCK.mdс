# GPT Project Lock (Canonical)

## Purpose

This document **locks the GPT project context**.

It defines:
- which files constitute the complete GPT context
- which files are allowed to influence AI reasoning
- which files are explicitly excluded
- how changes to the GPT context may occur

After this document is active, the GPT project context
is considered **frozen and authoritative**.

---

## Locked GPT Context

The GPT project context consists ONLY of the following files.

### Core Canonical Context
- `docs/INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md`
- `docs/CANONICAL_PROJECT_ORIENTATION.md`
- `docs/CANONICAL_DOCUMENTATION_INVENTORY.md`

### Authority & Locks
- `docs/AUTHORITY_MAP.md`
- `docs/FINAL_FOUNDATION_LOCK.md`
- `docs/TUI_ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md`
- All Authority Contracts explicitly listed in `AUTHORITY_MAP.md`

### Architecture Rules
- `docs/UI_ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`
- `docs/TUI_EXTENSION_CANONICAL_STATE.md`
- `docs/TUI_TOKEN_SYSTEM.md`

### Cursor Rules (Verified)
- `rules/user-rules.mdc`
- `rules/component-lifecycle.mdc`
- `rules/block-and-scope-rules.mdc`
- `rules/CURSOR_RULES_RESOLUTION_ORDER.mdc`
- `rules/CURSOR_RULES_VERIFICATION.mdc`

These files represent the **entire reasoning surface** available to AI.

No other files are considered part of the GPT context.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

The following are **explicitly excluded** from the GPT context
and MUST NOT influence AI reasoning:

- `docs_archive/**`
- historical audits
- migration reports
- one-time analyses
- experimental drafts
- deprecated or legacy documentation
- Cursor execution logs
- task reports and snapshots

Excluded files may exist in the repository
but are **non-authoritative**.

---

## Context Integrity Rules

The AI MUST:

- Rely ONLY on the locked GPT context
- Ignore excluded files entirely
- Never scan directories to infer context
- Never merge canonical and archived information

If required information is missing from the locked context,
the AI MUST ASK instead of guessing.

---

## Change Control Policy

Any modification to the GPT project context requires:

1. Explicit instruction to unlock this document
2. Clear justification for the change
3. Review against Authority Contracts and Locks
4. Re-locking with an updated version of this document

Silent or implicit changes are forbidden.

---

## Violation Handling

If a task requires violating this lock:

- The AI MUST REFUSE
- The refusal MUST reference this document
- A suggested next step MAY be provided

---

## Final Lock Statement

This document **locks the GPT project context**.

After this point:
- The context is stable
- The rules are deterministic
- The AI behavior is predictable

Any deviation is considered a violation.

**Status: LOCKED**
