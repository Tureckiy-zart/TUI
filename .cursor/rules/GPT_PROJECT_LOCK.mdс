# GPT Project Context Guidance (Canonical)

## Purpose

This document provides **guidance** for GPT project context usage.
It does **not** lock or restrict what files may be read or scanned.

---

## Context Scope

There is **no locked context**. The assistant may read and scan any files
needed to complete a task, subject to higher-priority architectural rules.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

None. Any file may be consulted if relevant, while treating canonical sources
as higher priority when conflicts arise.

---

## Context Integrity Rules

The AI SHOULD:
- Prefer canonical sources when resolving conflicts
- Verify critical claims against authoritative documents

---

## Change Control Policy

This document does not enforce locking. Updates are allowed by explicit request.

---

## Violation Handling

No lock-based violations apply.

---

## Final Statement

The GPT project context is **unlocked**. This document is guidance only.
