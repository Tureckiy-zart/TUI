# Documentation Structure Freeze Rules (Canonical)

## Purpose

This document defines **mandatory rules** for Cursor / AI when working with documentation structure in `docs/` directory.

These rules exist to prevent:
- Structural drift
- Unauthorized directory creation
- Placement of documents in wrong sections
- Unconscious structural changes

**Single Source of Truth:** `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md`

Compliance is mandatory.

---

## Structure Freeze Status

**Status:** 🔒 **FROZEN**  
**Date:** 2025-01-27

The current structure of `docs/` directory is **FROZEN** and **CANONICAL**. This structure represents the single source of truth for documentation organization.

---

## Canonical Top-Level Directories

The following top-level directories in `docs/` are **FROZEN**:

### 1. `docs/architecture/`
- **Purpose:** Authority Contracts, Architecture Rules, Locks, and architectural guidelines
- **Boundary:** Architecture rules and authority contracts ONLY
- **Forbidden:** Reference documentation, reports, or service documents

### 2. `docs/reference/`
- **Purpose:** API references, integration guides, typing standards, and usage examples
- **Boundary:** Developer-facing reference material ONLY
- **Forbidden:** Architecture rules or internal service documents

### 3. `docs/governance/`
- **Purpose:** Governance review cycles and review templates
- **Boundary:** Governance workflows and review documentation ONLY
- **Forbidden:** Architecture rules or primary reading route documents

### 4. `docs/workflows/`
- **Purpose:** Process workflows, checklists, and library maturity system
- **Boundary:** Workflow definitions and process documentation ONLY
- **Forbidden:** Architecture rules or reference documentation

### 5. `docs/reports/`
- **Purpose:** Reports and audit documentation
- **Boundary:** Project reports and audit documentation ONLY
- **Forbidden:** Primary reading route documents or architecture rules

### 6. `docs/migrations/`
- **Purpose:** Historical migration context and reports
- **Boundary:** Migration documentation ONLY
- **Forbidden:** Primary reading route documents or active architecture rules

### 7. `docs/_internal/`
- **Purpose:** Internal service documents (AI context only)
- **Boundary:** Service documents for AI context ONLY
- **Forbidden:** Reader-facing documentation or architecture rules

### 8. `docs/archive/` (if exists)
- **Purpose:** Non-canonical, archived documentation
- **Boundary:** Historical and deprecated documentation ONLY
- **Forbidden:** Active canonical documentation

---

## Structural Change Policy (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL RULE:** Any structural changes to `docs/` directory structure **MUST** be made through modification of `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md` first.

### Process for Structural Changes

The AI MUST follow this process:

1. **Proposal Phase:**
   - Document the proposed structural change
   - Justify why the change is architecturally necessary
   - Identify which documents will be affected

2. **Lock Update Phase:**
   - Update `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md` to reflect the new structure
   - Update the "Canonical Structure" section
   - Update the "Documentation Structure Freeze" section
   - Document the purpose and boundaries of any new directories

3. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Only after lock document is updated, implement the structural change
   - Move files according to the updated structure
   - Update all cross-references and links

4. **Verification Phase:**
   - Verify all files are in their canonical locations
   - Verify all links are valid
   - Verify no files are in unauthorized locations

---

## Forbidden Actions (MANDATORY REFUSAL)

The AI MUST REFUSE when a task requires:

- ❌ Creating new top-level directories in `docs/` without updating `DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md`
- ❌ Moving documents between top-level directories without updating the lock
- ❌ Placing reader-facing documents in `_internal/`
- ❌ Placing architecture rules in `reference/`
- ❌ Placing reference documentation in `architecture/`
- ❌ Any structural change without first updating `DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md`

---

## Enforcement Rules

### Document Placement Verification

Before creating or moving any document in `docs/`, the AI MUST:

1. **Verify canonical location:**
   - Check `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md` for correct placement
   - Verify the document type matches the directory purpose
   - Ensure no boundary violations

2. **If placement is unclear:**
   - The AI MUST STOP and ASK
   - The AI MUST NOT guess or assume
   - The AI MUST reference the lock document

### Violation Handling

**If a document violates structure:**
- The document is considered **non-canonical**
- The placement is considered an **error**
- The document MUST be moved to its canonical location

**If a file is placed outside its section:**
- This is a **structural violation**
- The file MUST be moved to the correct canonical location
- All references MUST be updated

**If a new directory is needed:**
- The lock document (`DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md`) **MUST** be updated first
- The new directory's purpose and boundaries **MUST** be documented
- Only after lock update can the directory be created

---

## Priority Principle

**Architecture and Governance have priority over convenience.**

- Structural stability is more important than temporary convenience
- All structural changes require architectural justification
- The lock document is the single source of truth

---

## Single Source of Truth

`docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md` is the **single source of truth** for documentation structure.

**All structural questions must be resolved by reference to this document.**

- ✅ If a directory is listed in `DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md` → it is canonical
- ❌ If a directory is not listed → it is non-canonical
- ✅ If a document's placement is described → it is correct
- ❌ If a document's placement contradicts the lock → it is incorrect

**No structural change can be made unconsciously.** All changes must pass through the lock document.

---

## Refusal Template

When refusing a task that violates structure rules, the AI MUST use this format:

```
❌ **Request Refused: Violates Documentation Structure Freeze**

Your request violates the following structure freeze rules:
- [Specific rule violated]

**Why this violates the rules:**
[Explanation of why the requested change violates the frozen structure]

**Required action:**
1. Update `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md` first
2. Document the structural change and justification
3. Then implement the change

**Reference:**
- `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md` - Single source of truth for structure
- `.cursor/rules/documentation-structure-freeze.mdc` - This rule document
```

---

## Verification Checklist

Before completing any documentation task, the AI MUST verify:

- ✅ Document placement matches canonical structure in `DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md`
- ✅ No new top-level directories created without lock update
- ✅ No documents moved between sections without lock update
- ✅ No reader-facing documents in `_internal/`
- ✅ No architecture rules in `reference/`
- ✅ No reference documentation in `architecture/`
- ✅ All structural changes went through lock document update first

---

## Final Enforcement Principle

**Structure discipline is mandatory.**

If the AI is unsure about document placement,
it MUST:
1. Reference `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTATION_CANON_LOCK.md`
2. Verify canonical location
3. If still unclear, STOP and ASK

**When in doubt — REFUSE or ASK.**

Silent compliance with structural violations is forbidden.
