# Reporting Discipline (Cursor) — Hard Limits

## Purpose

This document defines **mandatory hard limits** on report artifacts that Cursor / AI may create when executing tasks.

**CRITICAL:** This rule **does NOT modify** the canonical TUNG system specification (`docs/workflows/foundation/tung_system_specification.md`).  
This rule **only constrains Cursor deliverables behavior** and report artifact creation.

These rules exist to prevent:
- Report spam (excessive documentation artifacts)
- Information duplication across multiple files
- Uncontrolled report proliferation
- Token burn due to documentation noise

Compliance is mandatory.

---

## Scope & Rule Resolution Context

This rule applies to **ALL tasks** unless explicitly overridden via the override mechanism (R-CUR-8).

This rule operates at the **Cursor behavior layer** and does not conflict with TUNG.  
TUNG defines task structure and execution flow; this rule limits what **report files** Cursor creates as deliverables.

If a task requests more artifacts than allowed by this rule, Cursor MUST:
1) Consolidate into allowed files, and  
2) Add a one-line note: **"Consolidated due to Reporting Discipline cap."**

---

## Definitions

### Report artifact

A **report artifact** is **any NEW markdown file** created as task evidence/notes under:
- `docs/reports/**`
- `docs/**/locks/**`
- or any other documentation folder used for task reporting in this repository

**NOT report artifacts:**
- Code changes
- Storybook stories
- Tests (Playwright/Vitest)
- CI/workflow configs
- ESLint configs/rules
- Commit messages / PR descriptions

If Cursor is unsure whether a new file counts as a report artifact, it MUST assume it **does** and therefore consolidate.

---

## Hard Limits

### R-CUR-1: Default Cap (MANDATORY)

**MUST:** Maximum **2 NEW report artifacts** per task by default.

**Enforcement:** If a task would create more than 2 new report files, Cursor MUST consolidate information into the allowed 2 files instead.

---

### R-CUR-2: Allowed Reports (MANDATORY)

**MUST:** Only the following report types are allowed as NEW files (default mode):

1) **`<ticket>_patch.md`** — What changed and why  
   - Prefer ≤25 lines  
   - Contains: implementation changes, rationale, key decisions  
   - May embed as sections: targets, expected behavior, storybook steps, lock status notes

2) **`<ticket>_verify.md`** — Commands run and PASS/FAIL summary  
   - Prefer ≤25 lines  
   - Contains: commands executed, test results, compliance status  
   - **Single source of truth** for test execution claims (see R-CUR-6)

**FORBIDDEN:** Any other report file types are forbidden unless explicitly allowed by R-CUR-4 or R-CUR-8.

---

### R-CUR-3: Forbidden Split (MANDATORY)

**FORBIDDEN:** Standalone files for the following are forbidden:

- `targets_*.md` — MUST embed in `patch.md` (Implementation Targets section)
- `expected_behavior_*.md` — MUST embed in `patch.md` (Expected Behavior section)
- `storybook_steps_*.md` — MUST embed in `patch.md` (Storybook Validation section) OR in Storybook story description
- `release_notes_*.md` — MUST embed in `patch.md` (System Status Update section) OR in a Lock document (if applicable)

**MUST:** Embed this information inside `patch.md` as sections, or place it in PR description or Storybook story description.

**Rationale:** These are implementation details that belong in the patch document, not separate files.

---

### R-CUR-4: System-Doc Exception (MANDATORY)

**MUST:** Versioned canonical system documents (Audit/GAP/Lock) may be produced **ONLY** when the task is explicitly marked as `SYSTEM_UPDATE` in task metadata.

**Allowed canonical system doc types (when SYSTEM_UPDATE):**
- `*_AUDIT_REPORT.v*.md` — Audit reports
- `*_GAPS.v*.md` — GAP classifications
- `*_LOCK.v*.md` — Lock documents

**FORBIDDEN:** Creating canonical system docs for non-SYSTEM_UPDATE tasks.

**FORBIDDEN:** Creating additional narration documents beyond the caps defined below.

---

### R-CUR-5: SYSTEM_UPDATE Cap (MANDATORY)

**MUST:** For tasks explicitly marked as `SYSTEM_UPDATE`, maximum **4 NEW report artifacts** total.

**Breakdown:**
- 2 standard reports: `patch.md` + `verify.md` (as per R-CUR-2)
- + up to 2 canonical system docs (as per R-CUR-4)

**Canonical system docs allowance is LIMITED:**
- **Up to 2 canonical system docs total** (choose the minimum necessary), typically:
  - `LOCK` + (`AUDIT` **or** `GAPS`)
- A **third** canonical system doc requires `REPORTING_OVERRIDE`.

**FORBIDDEN:** Creating more than 4 total reports, even for SYSTEM_UPDATE tasks.

**FORBIDDEN:** Creating additional narration documents beyond the 4 allowed.

**Example (SYSTEM_UPDATE, ✅ allowed):**
- `GAP3_patch.md` + `GAP3_verify.md` + `FOCUS_AUDIT_REPORT.v1.1.md` + `FOCUS_LOCK.v1.1.md` (4 total)

**Example (❌ forbidden, 5 total):**
- `GAP3_patch.md` + `GAP3_verify.md` + `FOCUS_AUDIT_REPORT.v1.1.md` + `FOCUS_LOCK.v1.1.md` + `GAP3_summary.md`

---

### R-CUR-6: Single Source of Truth (MANDATORY)

**MUST:** `verify.md` is the **ONLY** document allowed to claim that tests ran or passed.

**FORBIDDEN:** Other documents (including `patch.md`) may NOT claim test execution or PASS status unless `verify.md` explicitly confirms it.

**Enforcement:** If `patch.md` mentions testing, it MUST reference `verify.md` as the source of truth.

**Example:**
- ✅ `verify.md`: "Playwright: ✅ PASS"
- ✅ `patch.md`: "Testing: see verify.md"
- ❌ `patch.md`: "Playwright: ✅ PASS" (without verify.md confirmation)

---

### R-CUR-7: No Duplication (MANDATORY)

**FORBIDDEN:** Repeating the same information across multiple documents.

**MUST:** If information must exist, keep it in `patch.md` only.  
**EXCEPTION:** Verification results MUST exist only in `verify.md` (see R-CUR-6).

**MUST:** Other documents may reference `patch.md` but must not duplicate its content.

**Enforcement:** If information appears in multiple files, Cursor MUST consolidate into the correct single location and remove duplicates.

---

### R-CUR-8: Override Mechanism (MANDATORY)

**MUST:** Exceeding the caps (R-CUR-1 or R-CUR-5) requires an **explicit flag** in task metadata:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "REPORTING_OVERRIDE": true,
    "REPORTING_OVERRIDE_REASON": "One-line justification here"
  }
}
````

**FORBIDDEN:** Creating extra report files without the override flag.

**FORBIDDEN:** Using override without providing a one-line justification.

**Override is exceptional:** repeated use across tasks is **FORBIDDEN** without explicit architect approval.

If override is used, Cursor MUST include the one-line justification in PR description or execution log.

---

### R-CUR-9: Enforcement (MANDATORY)

**MUST:** If caps are exceeded, the task is considered **FAILED** even if code works correctly.

**MUST:** Cursor MUST consolidate reports instead of adding more files.

**MUST:** Before marking a task as complete, Cursor MUST verify that report artifact count does not exceed limits.

Task completion requires:

1. Code works correctly
2. Report artifact count ≤ cap (2 default, 4 for SYSTEM_UPDATE)
3. No forbidden file types created
4. No information duplication
5. `verify.md` is the single source of truth for test execution claims

If any condition fails, task is FAILED and must be fixed before completion.

---

## Decision Tree

**Where to put information?**

```
Implementation details → patch.md
Test results → verify.md (ONLY source of truth)
Storybook steps → Storybook story description OR patch.md (Storybook Validation section)
Release notes / status update → Lock doc OR patch.md (System Status Update section)
Targets / Expected behavior → patch.md (embedded sections)
Canonical system docs → Only if SYSTEM_UPDATE (count toward cap)
```

**Decision flow:**

1. Is this test execution/result? → `verify.md` ONLY
2. Is this implementation detail? → `patch.md` (embed as section)
3. Is this canonical system doc? → Only if SYSTEM_UPDATE, count toward cap
4. Would this create >2 files (or >4 for SYSTEM_UPDATE)? → Consolidate into existing files

---

## Examples

### GOOD Deliverables (Default Task)

**Task:** Fix GAP-3 Drawer focus issue

**Deliverables:**

* `GAP3_patch.md` (contains: changes, targets, expected behavior, storybook steps — embedded as sections)
* `GAP3_verify.md` (contains: commands, PASS/FAIL results)

**Total:** 2 files (within cap)

---

### GOOD Deliverables (SYSTEM_UPDATE Task)

**Task:** Fix GAP-3 and re-lock Focus system (SYSTEM_UPDATE)

**Deliverables:**

* `GAP3_patch.md`
* `GAP3_verify.md`
* `FOCUS_AUDIT_REPORT.v1.1.md`
* `FOCUS_LOCK.v1.1.md`

**Total:** 4 files (within cap)

---

### BAD Deliverables (Default Task)

**Task:** Fix GAP-3 Drawer focus issue

**Deliverables:**

* `GAP3_patch.md`
* `GAP3_targets.md` (FORBIDDEN — should be in patch.md)
* `GAP3_expected_behavior.md` (FORBIDDEN — should be in patch.md)
* `GAP3_storybook_steps.md` (FORBIDDEN — should be in patch.md or story description)
* `GAP3_release_notes.md` (FORBIDDEN — should be in patch.md or lock doc)
* `GAP3_verify.md`

**Total:** 6 files (EXCEEDS cap, task FAILED)

**Fix:** Consolidate forbidden files into `patch.md` as sections.

---

### BAD Deliverables (Information Duplication)

**Task:** Fix GAP-3 Drawer focus issue

**Deliverables:**

* `GAP3_patch.md` (claims "Playwright: ✅ PASS")
* `GAP3_verify.md` (claims "Playwright: ✅ PASS")

**Problem:** Test result claim exists in patch.md.
**Fix:** `patch.md` must say "Testing: see verify.md" instead.

---

## Relationship to TUNG System

**This rule does NOT modify the TUNG system specification.**

* **TUNG** defines: task structure, execution flow, step definitions, subtask relationships
* **This rule** defines: Cursor behavior for creating report artifacts as deliverables

**Compatibility:**

* TUNG tasks may specify deliverables, but Cursor MUST still respect R-CUR-1 through R-CUR-9
* If a task specifies deliverables that violate this rule, Cursor MUST consolidate them
* `SYSTEM_UPDATE` aligns with R-CUR-4 and R-CUR-5

Reference: `docs/workflows/foundation/tung_system_specification.md` (unchanged by this rule)

---

## Enforcement Checklist

Before marking any task as complete, Cursor MUST verify:

* [ ] Report artifact count ≤ cap (2 default, 4 for SYSTEM_UPDATE)
* [ ] Only allowed report types created (`patch.md`, `verify.md`, canonical system docs if SYSTEM_UPDATE)
* [ ] No forbidden file types (`targets_*.md`, `expected_behavior_*.md`, `storybook_steps_*.md`, `release_notes_*.md`)
* [ ] No information duplication (test results only in `verify.md`)
* [ ] `verify.md` is single source of truth for test execution claims
* [ ] Override flag present if caps exceeded (with justification)

If any check fails, the task is FAILED and must be fixed.

---

## Final Enforcement Principle

**Report discipline is mandatory.**

If Cursor is unsure whether a report file is allowed, it MUST assume it is **FORBIDDEN** and consolidate into existing files.

**When in doubt — CONSOLIDATE, don't CREATE.**

**This rule is MANDATORY. Any work violating these limits is INVALID.**
