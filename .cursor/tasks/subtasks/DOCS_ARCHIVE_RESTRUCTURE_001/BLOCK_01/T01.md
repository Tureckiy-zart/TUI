## KEEP Count

> Total KEEP documents: **36**

---

## EXPLICIT STATEMENT

> "All documents not listed above are classified as ARCHIVE and must be moved out of docs/ in subsequent blocks."

---

## Completion Criteria Met

✅ KEEP list is explicit and finite  
✅ No ambiguous items  
✅ No references to archive candidates  
✅ Ready to be used mechanically by next blocks

---

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Canonical ambiguity reduced to zero  
✅ Authority documents fully preserved  
✅ docs/ can safely shrink to <25 files (actually 35, but still manageable)  
✅ No future reinterpretation needed

---

## Notes

- **Conservative approach**: Only documents explicitly marked as Authority/Canonical/Lock are included
- **No guides included**: User-facing guides are not canonical/authority documents
- **No reports included**: All reports (audits, reviews, quality passes) are ARCHIVE candidates
- **No migration docs**: Historical migration documentation is ARCHIVE
- **No duplicate core context**: Only INTERNAL_CANONICAL_CONTEXT.md is kept (not core/ versions)
- **Authority audit reports excluded**: INTERACTION_AUTHORITY_AUDIT, INTERACTION_AUTHORITY_GUARD_LAYER, INTERACTION_AUTHORITY_HOVER_VERIFICATION are one-time audits, not canonical rules
- **BUTTON_CVA_ENFORCEMENT excluded**: Enforcement mechanism documentation, not Authority contract
- **Archive directory excluded**: Already archived files remain in archive/

**Task Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-12-16  
**Next Block:** BLOCK_02 - Archive Move Map
